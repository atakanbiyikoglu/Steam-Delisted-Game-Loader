# Steam Delisted Game Loader

A utility tool designed to automate the retrieval and installation of games that are no longer listed on the Steam store but remain accessible via database IDs.

**How it works:**
- Parses local data files for AppIDs.
- Interacts with Steam's protocol (`steam://install/`) to trigger background processes.
- Developed for bulk library management.
